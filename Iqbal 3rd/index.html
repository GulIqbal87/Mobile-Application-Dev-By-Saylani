    Established in May 1999 by famous spiritual and religious scholar Maulana Bashir Ahmed Farooqui, Saylani Welfare International Trust was built <br>
     on the fundamentals of breaking the cycle of poverty, alleviating the financial troubles of the poor, giving people a chance to live a dignified life <br> and spreading happiness. <br>
     We are an organization that believes in lighting up the lives of underprivileged people across the world. We endeavor to provide the best quality <br> 
     services in areas including food, education, medical and social welfare free of cost to people living in the dark. With over 60 different sectors, we <br> 
     feed thousands of hungry people each day, hundreds more are given the hope of life through medical health care, many are educated to <br> 
     become leaders of tomorrow and several are given the opportunity to stand on their feet financially. <br>
     Today, we are proud to say that our physical presence extends throughout Pakistan with a vast network of 125 branches operating in major <br>
     cities including Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad and Faisalabad. Apart from Pakistan, we have overseas offices in the UK, USA <br>
     and UAE as well. Our worldwide branches are operating under the guidance of a team of over 2,000 working professionals who help almost <br>
     125,000 people on a daily basis. <br>
     <p>
        We strongly believe that a little help goes a long way and our work would not be possible without the generous support of our valuable donors. <br>
        Our local and international donors have graciously lent us a hand by supporting our causes and enabling us to serve the needs of people in <br>
        need.
